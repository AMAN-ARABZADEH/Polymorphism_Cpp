# Polymorphism Example in C++
Example how Polymorphism  works in C++. Also known as third pillar of object-oriented programming.


## Introduction:

This repository I provide an example of how polymorphism in C++ works. 
The aim is to showcase how polymorphism enables code flexibility and extensibility by working with different derived classes through a common interface.

## Description:

Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, allowing objects of different classes that are related through inheritance to be treated interchangeably. 
In this code, we have a base class called "Shape," which serves as an abstract class with a pure virtual function called "calculateArea()." 
This function is not implemented in the base class but is instead overridden in the derived classes: "Rectangle," "Triangle," "Square," and "Circle." 
Each derived class provides its own implementation of the "calculateArea()" function, specific to the shape it represents.

The power of polymorphism is demonstrated through the "displayArea()" function, which accepts a const reference to a "Shape" object. 
By using polymorphism, this function can call the appropriate "calculateArea()" function based on the actual type of the object passed to it. 
This means that a single function can produce the correct behavior based on the runtime type of the object, regardless of whether it is a rectangle, triangle, square, or circle.

## How to Use:

To use this code, simply compile and run the provided C++ file using a compatible compiler. 
The code will create objects of different shapes, such as a rectangle, triangle, square, and circle, 
and then calculate and display their respective areas using the overridden "calculateArea()" function.

## Benefits of Polymorphism:

Polymorphism offers several benefits in software development:

- Code Flexibility: Polymorphism allows us to write more flexible code that can handle objects of different derived classes through a common interface, making the code adaptable to various scenarios.

- Code Extensibility: New shapes can be easily added as derived classes without modifying the existing code that operates on the base class interface. This promotes code extensibility and modularity, enabling the system to grow and evolve smoothly.

- Code Reusability: By utilizing polymorphism, we can reuse the same code that operates on the base class interface for different derived classes. This saves development time and effort by avoiding redundant code.

- Maintainability and Scalability: Polymorphism simplifies code maintenance and enhances scalability. As new shapes are added, the existing codebase remains unchanged, reducing the chances of introducing bugs or errors.
